# Math Operations
sum_result = 10+5 #addtion
difference_result = 10-5 #subtraction
product_result = 10*5 #multiplication
quotient_result = 10/5 #division
modulus_result = 10%3 #modulus, finding the remainder after division
exponent_result = 10**2 #exponents, raising one number to the power of another
import math
squareroot = math.sqrt(25) #squareroot
